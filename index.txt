owb_execs						Find the execution history of a specific node (leaf node or subflow) and remaining time until the end of main flow or other node
sqltune_exec				Tune a specific sql_id by creating a tuning task and calling DBMS_SQLTUNE.EXECUTE_TUNING_TASK
						    		(Note: you must login to the same instance as the one running the sql_id because the script assumes the sql_id is loaded in the library cache)
sqltune_report			Report of the results of a sql tuning task (including recommendations with respective sql statements)						    		
fs_awr							Find SQL in DBA_HIST_SQLSTAT
xplan_awr_all				Display the execution plan (display option ALL) for a specific cursor (sql_id and child number) as well as 
								    hash_plan_value  from AWR. (dbms_xplan.display_awr format option 'ADVANCED ALLSTATS LAST')
xplan_rac						Display the execution plan for a specific cursor (sql_id and child number).
									  You dont have to explicitly log in to a specific instance (in a RAC), to find the execution plan in the library cache of a node. It uses 
									  gv$sql_plan_statistics_all as a plan_table input to DBMS_XPLAN.DISPLAY in order to get the execution plan in loaded in the library cache of any RAC instance.
									  (format parameter: 'ALL ALLSTATS LAST -PROJECTION')
xplan_rac_all				Display the execution plan (display option ADVANCED) for a specific cursor (sql_id and child number) or the last statement for this session from library cache
									  You dont have to explicitly log in to a specific instance (in a RAC), to find the execution plan in the library cache of a node. It uses 
									  gv$sql_plan_statistics_all as a plan_table input to DBMS_XPLAN.DISPLAY in order to get the execution plan in loaded in the library cache of any RAC instance.									
									  (format parameter: 'ADVANCED ALLSTATS LAST')
rollback_t					Estimate how much time is remaining for all sessions of a sql_id to rollback (You can use it for a specific session too)
